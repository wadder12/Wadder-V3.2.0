Bravo Company - 🟩・minecraft-chat - Adware#0110: I ended up just unclaiming the area to avoid ongoing issues - so we'll have to work through the claims & parties system

Bravo Company - 🟩・minecraft-chat - Adware#0110: Got a pig farm going
Bravo Company - 🟩・minecraft-chat - Adware#0110: Uses a feeding trough so that you can just load it with food, the mobs get crushed and then drops go into the chest
Bravo Company - 🟩・minecraft-chat - Adware#0110: They auto breed as long as you keep food in the trough
Bravo Company - 🟩・minecraft-chat - Adware#0110: made a little food farm to fill the troughs and for whatever else - we need carrots and onions for the farm - we'll replace a row of tomatoes with each
Bravo Company - 🟩・minecraft-chat - Adware#0110: I also have the villagers moved over to the base to build the iron farm, ironically, I need more iron to finish building the iron farm.... I need 3 more hoppers
Bravo Company - 🟩・minecraft-chat - Adware#0110: I also build a dripstone and lava farm (small ones) under the house
Bravo Company - 🧟・dayz-chat - redchinman#4859: Good shit u on tonight or working?
Bravo Company - 🧟・dayz-chat - ViralSyn#1722: no i got to work. good thing i got on though looks as though he was waiting for someone to come on and open the door
Bravo Company - 🧟・dayz-chat - ViralSyn#1722: everyone needs to start A. checking the sheds before entering the tower. and B. closing the lockers because why else do we put codelocks on them.
Bravo Company - 🧟・dayz-chat - ViralSyn#1722: also where is our front door? the interior door is there but no front door
Bravo Company - 🧟・dayz-chat - redchinman#4859: Yea I was curious about everyone of them being open...the lockers, as far as front door maybe someone is already working on hitting us maybe, bcuz al doors were there when I logged last night
Bravo Company - 🧟・dayz-chat - ViralSyn#1722: then im calling all hands on deck ASAP and working to secure the base
Bravo Company - 🧟・dayz-chat - ViralSyn#1722: ill see if i can get the front door fixed
